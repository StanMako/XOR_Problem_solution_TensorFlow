This programs solves XOR Problem by neural network using TensorFlow sigmoid activation function. 
The neural network contains two denses, including three neurons overall, backpropagation and sigmoid activation function.
The results are shown here, where we can see the last values received from the error function, the number of epochs and the predicted values for each of the XOR points after the model is trained.
